								AhnLab Malware Defense System (MDS) Enterprise is not your traditional endpoint security solution.

How is it different? Unlike traditional blacklist or whitelist-based endpoint solutions, AhnLab MDS Enterprise provides real-time visibility and proactive response for unknown threats by performing a full inspection on all endpoints within the enterprise. 
So what do we find from full inspection? By monitoring file, process, memory, network, registry, and kernel of the entire endpoints, AhnLab MDS Enterprise collects the following file information: inflow, creation, execution, distribution, and correlated behaviors between files. Combined with AhnLab&rsquo;s cloud and correlation analysis, the collected information is used to automatically classify each file as normal, malicious, or unknown.

While malicious activities are immediately blocked or isolated, files or behaviors classified as unknown goes through multiple real-time analysis methods. Investigating the source, behavior, reputation, network connection, and possible internal spread increases the accuracy of identification. Through this process, AhnLab MDS Enterprise delivers &ldquo;No suspicious, no unknown&rdquo;. This instant and automatic response against threats dramatically reduces the amount of time required to analyze and respond to malware &ndash; from a full day to less than an hour. Therefore, damages can be minimized or avoided entirely, which is an essential factor to business continuity.

								Sentinel is an enterprise-class, advanced endpoint threat detection and response platform. It delivers comprehensive attack intelligence to security teams so they can quickly identify and eliminate targeted threats on desktops and servers. 

CounterTack&rsquo;s driverless kernel module provides low-level visibility into malicious behavior from a stealth position, with no user presence and no impact on endpoint performance or stability. Sentinel not only sees attacker behavior, it captures all events that unfold as part of that attack. This unprecedented visibility provides real-time context as threats escalate, so teams can make better security decisions. 

Sentinel combines real-time OS-level surveillance with Big Data analytics to deliver automated threat detection, context and visibility across the enterprise. Sentinel also ships with an advanced set of indicator profiles that automate the analysis of known and unknown threats. The built-in, and learned intelligence over time, characterizes attack techniques in real-time, like antivirus disabling, firewall modification and evasion, where signature-based analysis and whitelisting solutions are blind.							</td>

								CSG Invotas&trade; is a new security orchestration solution launching in January 2014 that dynamically shifts the security state of the network at &ldquo;machine speed,&rdquo; greatly reducing the time it takes to contain and mitigate security incidents. It handles many of the tasks that security analysts do manually, by capturing their knowledge, automating or semi-automating their workflows, and orchestrating changes to network infrastructure configurations triggered by security or business events. The CSG Invotas solution works with SIEMs to effectively automate threat response in real time by blending threat management technology, automated network control, and business workflow management.

Key Features:
- Builds and implements a cyber-playbook of threat profiles and security states
- Supports creation of new courses of action or pre-planned courses of action, and combines them to effect coordinated enterprise changes
- Synchronizes large-scale changes using controlled automation, with analyst oversight
- Security controls can be varied or randomized, making compromise attempts much more difficult and detectable
- Acts on business and security triggers
- Offers low risk, low cost phased deployment
- A unifying layer to operate security tools							</td>

SolarSecure DoS, when used with Solarflare&rsquo;s Flareon&trade; 10/40GbE server adapters provides enhanced host protection from Denial of Service, and Distributed Denial of Service attacks by implementing advanced filtering, SYN cookies, blocking, and rate-limiting functions directly into the networking stack. Available as a kernel driver, or as an add-on to OpenOnload&reg;, the implementation of these functions takes place on the adapter hardware and software stacks without involving the kernel or applications running on the kernel. This results in dramatically reduced latency and CPU utilization, while increasing message rates and bandwidth to hosted services. SolarSecure includes an API that provides dynamic control over these functions enabling hardened hosts at the network edge for service providers of content delivery networks and  enterprise data centers.

								As the threat of cyber attack grows and all companies become targets, the ability to hire and maintain a dedicated cyber threat defense team, deploy the advanced technology required to detect and defend from an attack and update, educate and improve both people and technology is simply out of reach for all but the world&rsquo;s largest and most secure organizations. To solve this problem Verdasys introduced its Managed Service for Cyber Defense (MSCD), an all-inclusive solution for host based cyber attack protection completely hosted and managed by Verdasys&#039; data security experts.  Verdasys MSCD offers a proven cyber defense platform that supports advanced malware prevention, detection, investigation and reporting across host systems in any organization, regardless of if these systems are in multiple geographic locations, and both on and off the network.  Verdasys MSCD also integrates with your gateway, network cyber defense products and your SIEM tool to offer the most complete cyber threat defense platform available as a managed service.  Verdasys MSCD will greatly reduce the risk that cyber attacks succeed in penetrating your network and, with multiple layers of defense, including an infection incident, prevent that attack from accessing and exfiltrating your sensitive data that the attack is targeting.							</td>
