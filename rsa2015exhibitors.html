These include call centers and hospitals, further expanding to hydropower, nuclear plants and online game servers as well.

								Interset 3 is an advance threat detection platform.  It utilizes a unique mix of data connectors and sensors to collect metadata from enterprise application logs, standing security systems, file-share servers and endpoints. Interset 3 then aggregates and correlates collected data focusing on the interactions between accounts, devices, applications and files. Interset 3 runs this information through its patent-pending advanced behavioral analytics engine creating relationship baselines for and applying risk scores to all entities and events. Anomalous behaviors are quickly and accurately surfaced and relevant contextual event information displayed.  This actionable information enables security teams to know when they are under attack in real-time, removing the noise and false positives while surfacing the true threats so that they can be stopped before data is compromised.							</td>

								LightCyber Magna 2.8 release introduces the following new products and features:  Magna Probe: The Magna Probe product line is an additional component of the Magna Platform that extends network visibility to enterprise branch offices or additional locations, performs the data collection and inspection functions and forwards necessary data back to a Detector for profiling and analysis. Additional Cloud-based Threat Intelligence: To augment the program&rsquo;s profiling-based detection, LightCyber Magna extends the Magna Cloud with sandboxing capabilities to inspect suspicious executables collected at the endpoint using the agentless Magna Pathfinder. It also introduces domain threat intelligence to identify attackers&rsquo; command &amp; control communications. These capabilities augment the primary network-based breach detection techniques, and provide security operations with additional forensics information. Expanded Integration with Firewall Solutions: LightCyber Magna v 2.8 also adds Palo Alto Networks technology to its list of certified integrations. The integration, specifically with the Palo Alto Networks Next-Generation Firewall &ndash; a key component of the Palo Alto Networks enterprise security platform &ndash; enables security operators to automatically isolate and contain suspicious or known-breached endpoints, thus cutting off exfiltration and preventing damage. The only cyber security breach detection solution to combine network-based deep packet inspection with endpoint state, LightCyber Magna profiles user and device behavior to identify anomalous attack behavior that is indicative of a security breach. Highly accurate behavior-based breach detection provides enterprise security operators with actionable and prioritized alerts that help reduce attack dwell time and damage potential.							</td>
