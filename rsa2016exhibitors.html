								Appthority now offers powerful iOS and Android apps to enhance proactive management of mobile app risk through employee education and real-time device protection. 

The apps scan employees&rsquo; mobile apps for compliance with IT whitelists and approved behaviors. Employees are guided to remove non-compliant apps and can choose from a list of compliant apps by app store category. A search feature lets users see if an app they&rsquo;d like to install is compliant before installing it. Educating employees and arming them with proactive tools significantly reduces enterprise mobile app risk.

Appthority&rsquo;s new mobile apps also immediately detect when a malicious app is installed intentionally through a wrapped 3rd party app store app or unintentionally through a social offer via an ad network, even if it is not known malware or not installed from unofficial Apple and Google app stores. Both IT and the employee are notified immediately with remediation options and instructions.							</td>

								DB Networks Layer 7 Database Sensor is a data center security product that is designed to provide deep insights into the database infrastructure. It uses deep protocol inspection of the database traffic to provide new insights and a situational awareness of the overall database infrastructure.

Operating at the database tier, directly in front of the database servers, the Layer 7 Database Sensor is in the perfect location to effectively analyze database traffic. It will immediately identify any undocumented databases, identify traffic to/from restricted segments, and identify advanced database attacks. When rogue SQL statements are present at the database tier it means the perimeter defenses have been breached and the application has also been exploited. Information collected by the Layer 7 Database Sensor is integrated with SIEMs, Breach Detection Systems, or Threat Intelligence Systems for true full-spectrum network visibility.							</td>

								MediaPro has revolutionized the monitoring and delivery of any security, privacy, or compliance awareness program with its SAAS-based Adaptive Awareness Portal. This cloud-based platform enables executive stakeholders and program administrators to report on any element of their program from a single integrated interface. There is no reason to cobble together a solution from home-grown or multi-vendor solutions. Instead, using the Adaptive Awareness Portal, you can survey employees; run phishing campaigns; plan year-round programs; deliver training; and offer continuous reinforcement (in the forms of videos and games), all from a single interface. The use of Dashboards allows anyone to visualize relationships from the data generated by connected services, providing evidence about where the program is working and where it needs to improve. Most importantly, this allows administrators to provide executive insight into the ROI on efforts to turn end users into positive agents for change.							</td>

								STEALTHbits Technologies is pleased to announce StealthDEFEND, the first purpose-built, user behavior analytics solution for protecting against account compromise and abuse.

Threat Detection Through Real-Time User Behavior Analytics 
Despite millions of dollars spent in security software and hardware, companies are still getting breached daily. The majority of the time, these breaches hinge on gaining access to information through the theft or abuse of legitimate accounts. Traditional technologies have proven ineffective to stop the problem.
StealthDEFEND detects and disables compromised and abused accounts without the false positives.

The STEALTHbits Advantage
StealthDEFEND combines user behavior analytics and machine learning with access auditing and sensitive data discovery to detect abnormal account behavior, and accurately assess the risk associated with such behavior.

However, organizations are often hampered in taking advantage of these platforms or find that they are in violation of compliance standards when sensitive data moves off premises.  The Vormetric Cloud Encryption Gateway has expanded its support to include Microsoft OneDrive and Caringo.  Now these environments, like Box and Amazon S3, can be controlled by IT by enforcing on-premises encryption and key management. In addition, the platform delivers policy based access control and reporting.  The result is accelerated, safe and compliant use of cloud storage.							</td>

								The QS1 Privacy Case is the easy-to-use, non-intrusive, and intuitive security solution that solves the problem of eavesdropping and hacking by creating a secure environment within the case that is separate and apart from the phone&rsquo;s vulnerable operating system. This includes both an external processor to encrypt calls, texts, and images; a camera shutter; a microphone jammer to disrupt the device&rsquo;s internal microphones; and independent microphone that allow users to encrypt their calls before they enter the device. The QS1 preserves the functionality of the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy without compromising usability.

This fusion of independent hardware components with off-the-shelf devices sets Vysk apart from its competition, which relies entirely on software solutions. Vysk&rsquo;s combines the most trusted cryptography with the protections and anonymity of the Vysk Privacy Network, which protects users by not creating, collecting or storing valuable, identifying metadata.							</td>
