2016-02-05 Update: added [RSA 2016](http://www.rsaconference.com/events/us16) analysis.

The annual security conference, [RSA 2015](http://www.rsaconference.com/events/us15), is right around the corner. Close to 30,000 attendees will descend into [San Francisco Moscone Center](http://moscone.com) to attend 400+ sessions, listen to 600+ speakers and talk to close to 600 vendors and exhibitors.

For me, the most interesting aspect of RSA is walking the expo floor, and listening to how vendors describe their products. Intuitively, the vendor marketing messages should have a high degree of correlation to what customers care about, even if the messages trail the actual pain points slightly. 

[This post](http://zhen.org/blog/analyzing-security-trends-using-rsa-exhibitor-descriptions/) highlights some of the unsurprising findings from analyzing 8 years worth of RSA Conference exihibitor descriptions. 

This repo contains the analyzed data set and generated results.
